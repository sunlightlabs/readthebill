The ballot counter was replaced by election judges but was not reactivated.  171 ballots remained in their ballot box until today, when the box was reopened during the hand recount.

Would it be possible (or useful) to have a sympathetic Senator request a GAO report on the use of technology in the Senate?  Or on opportunities for Congressional transparency?</p></blockquote>\n<p>I agree with the first sentence.  There&#8217;s a backlog of reports requested, though, and first priority is given to committee chairs&#8217; requests.  (Here&#8217;s the GAO document (<a href=\"http://www.gao.gov/special.pubs/d01145g.pdf\">pdf</a>) that lays out their triage arrangement for requests.)  They&#8217;re also all public, although some of them are <a href=\"http://www.theopenhouseproject.com/2008/09/27/a-foia-request-waiting-to-happen/\">withheld</a> from web publication by agency request.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure how likely it is that GAO (or Congress) would prepare a report on transparency; CRS is more likely to respond (or to be asked) to prepare such a report.  One recent, very similar report was prepared by Walter Oleszek, which I reviewed <a href=\"http://www.theopenhouseproject.com/2007/09/05/crs-on-sunlight-and-the-open-house-project/\">here</a>, in September of 2007.  I&#8217;m not sure if the report has been updated since, but it&#8217;s a great resource.</p>\n<p>Applying GAO to Congress isn&#8217;t done all that frequently (as far as I&#8217;m aware), since GAO is a legislative support agency (like CRS or CBO), though of a slightly different type, acting often more like an executive agency.  GAO&#8217;s statutory requirement to review financial disclosure within all 3 branches has been (apparently) <a href=\"http://blog.sunlightfoundation.com/2007/12/17/the-gaos-unheeded-mandate/\">routinely ignored</a> since approximately 1990.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Whether it arrived in time to be useful to the Open Senate Project (doubtful), the examination process should provide very helpful ideas and motivation for progress.  Perhaps a broader study could even provide a template for how the Obama administration could deploy technology and transparency to the executive branch agencies.</p></blockquote>\n<p>With those cautions in mind, I&#8217;d love to see a GAO review of transparency in Congress, or even across all three branches, especially since many of the disclosure requirements have roots in the same laws (like the Ethics in Government Act, which sets financial disclosure requirements for high ranking staff in all three branches.)  This is probably one among many tools to spur Congress into some constructive introspection, including CRS reports, committee hearings, legislation, sense of the Congress resolutions, informal advisory recommendations (cf this list, OMBWatch&#8217;s report, or the ABA rulemaking report), lawsuits, committee reports, rulebreakers and internal champions, <a href=\"http://www.cqpolitics.com/wmspage.cfm?docID=weeklyreport-000002992032\">media coverage</a>, etc.   It would likely have to come from some committee chair (or leadership figure) with relevant jurisdiction, like a leg. branch approps chair, government reform chair (in the House) or gov&#8217;t affairs cmte chair (in the Senate).</p>\n<blockquote><p>2. GAO studies typically last around a year, and upon their completion they are published online.    But why are they only published when they are done?  This is a public interest process.

This is a job that screams &#8220;crowdsourcing/wisdom of crowds&#8221;.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I agree with this in spirit, but I strongly fear unintended consequences here.  Take the Office of Legislative Counsel, for example.  This is a quiet, isolated room full of legal scholars with expertise in the actual drafting of laws.  They operate under strict guidelines over what they can share, since the same drafters could conceivably be asked to write opposing bills for political opponents.  Maintaining confidentiality and objectivity is essential, since everyone has an interest in trusting that bills will be well written.</p>\n<p>The same is true for some CRS documents (those we&#8217;re NOT asking to have published), where Members sometimes turn for confidential advice.  I think confusion between these documents and the circulable documents causes some of the resistance to an open CRS we find on the hill.</p>\n<p>GAO, not unlike a police department, needs whatever tools are necessary for effective oversight, and publishing only completed documents probably falls into that category.</p>\n<blockquote><p>What&#8217;s more, a collaborative process would both (a) allow input and ideas from citizens, and (b) allow experts (and yes, lobbyists) to make their arguments publicly, where they can (and should) be considered and integrated into the thought process.  That could provide a useful way to evaluate the reports and the input of various groups, too (Did their predictions obtain in reality? Were important ideas ignored?)</p></blockquote>\n<p>Again, with those cautions in place, I&#8217;m a HUGE fan of the idea that an empowered public can strengthen our checks and balances, and reinstate effective oversight both within and between branches.  That&#8217;s why I&#8217;d like to see <a href=\"http://www.theopenhouseproject.com/2008/10/26/required-reports-a-proposal-for-an-aggregated-view/\">a collection</a> of upcoming reports to Congress (since it would empower public watchdogs and oversight staff alike), and why I started the (now defunct) <a href=\"http://www.dkosopedia.com/wiki/Congressional_Committees_Project\">Congressional Committees Project</a> two years ago.</p>\n<p>Integrating public activity into carefully constructed government processes can be tricky, which is one reason that the <a href=\"http://www.peertopatent.org/\">Peer to Patent Project</a>&#8217;s success is so impressive &#8212; it&#8217;s obviously the product of some brilliant and careful planning.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d love to see oversight committees, GAO, or even CRS start to address the possibilities presented to them by communities such as this one, but the first steps are hard to find, especially for as heated a topic as oversight, where jurisdictions are carefully protected, and where the stakes are especially high for those under investigation.  If even commenting on the quintessentially public bill is so hard to implement, a publicly empowered oversight process will be even tougher to generate.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a good first step, though, that people within those institutions we wish to change are following along closely (many are on this list), and that policy makers and the media are recognizing the developing capacity for public relevance.</p>", "date_published": "2008-12-03 15:48:08", "link": "http://blog.sunlightfoundation.com/2008/12/03/on-oversight-in-public/", "date_updated": "2008-12-03 16:06:18"}}, {"pk": 42, "model": "feedinator.feedentry", "fields": {"feed": 5, "author_uri": null, "last_fetched": "2008-12-03 16:56:23", "uid": "http://firedoglake.com/2008/12/03/gm-financed-50-of-car-purchases-last-year-can-only-finance-6-now/", "title": "GM Financed 50% of Car Purchases Last Year; Can Only Finance 6% Now", "author_email": null, "author_name": "emptywheel", "summary": "GM's description of its inability to give consumers credits cuts to the heart of its problem right now.", "content": "<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/kenstein/180972098/\"><img src=\"http://static1.firedoglake.com/1/files//2008/11/chevy.thumbnail.jpg\" class=\"imgLeft\" alt=\"chevy.thumbnail.jpg\" /></a></p>\n<p>Jeebus. <a href=\"http://static1.firedoglake.com/28/files//2008/12/1202gmplan.pdf\">This</a> gives you a sense of why GM's in such dire straits: </p>\n<blockquote><div class=\"wbq\"><p>GM\u2018s financing arm, GMAC, cannot effectively access the secondary markets today.

That number has fallen to 6% today</strong>. In addition, GMAC is no longer able to buy contracts for customers with a credit score under 700, which excludes roughly half the buying population. All of this has been especially toxic to GM sales in the past two months, with sales running about 40% behind year-ago levels.

The reason Nate's thesis is so disturbing is that <a href=\"http://www.democracycorps.com/strategy/2008/12/the-president-elects-standing-now-and-1992/?section=Survey\">a new Democracy Corps poll</a> shows he is probably correct.<br />\r<p>More in the extended entry. <br /> First, Nate writes:\r<p><blockquote>The Democratic message in 2010 will essentially be one of two things...<br />\r<p>1. Obama's accomplished X, Y and Z and showed the country the way forward, let's give him leaders in Congress who can continue to deliver for the middle class, or,<br />\r<p>2. Obama accomplished X, but he couldn't accomplish Y and Z because the Republicans obstructed those measures to protect the special interests ... let's put partisanship behind us and elect leaders in Congress who can represent the common good.</blockquote>\r<p>Nate is correct about the messaging. That is how Democrats will run in 2010. However, <a href=\"http://www.democracycorps.com/strategy/2008/12/the-president-elects-standing-now-and-1992/?section=Survey\">a Democracy Corps poll released today</a> shows that this legislation needs to be passed quickly and produce quick results. Otherwise, two years from now, the country won't still be overwhelmingly blaming Republicans if it doesn't:\r<p><blockquote>Q.32 Now I'm going to read you some pairs of statements.

There is no grace period when the country will still vote for Democrats just because they hate Republicans. Democratic hopes in 2010 and 2012 rest entirely on our governing record during the next two to four years. Polling and election results show that Republican obstructionism will not be accepted as an excuse, and neither will be starting from the bottom of the deep hole Bush and Republicans dug for us. If we don't make things better, Republicans will immediately become competitive again, and the 2010-2012 political environment could be a lot more like 2000-2004 than 2005-2008.<br />\r<p>In two years time, simply being a Democrat will no longer good enough to be elected.

The reason Nate's thesis is so disturbing is that <a href=\"http://www.democracycorps.com/strategy/2008/12/the-president-elects-standing-now-and-1992/?section=Survey\">a new Democracy Corps poll</a> shows he is probably correct.<br />\r<p>More in the extended entry. <br /> First, Nate writes:\r<p><blockquote>The Democratic message in 2010 will essentially be one of two things...<br />\r<p>1. Obama's accomplished X, Y and Z and showed the country the way forward, let's give him leaders in Congress who can continue to deliver for the middle class, or,<br />\r<p>2. Obama accomplished X, but he couldn't accomplish Y and Z because the Republicans obstructed those measures to protect the special interests ... let's put partisanship behind us and elect leaders in Congress who can represent the common good.</blockquote>\r<p>Nate is correct about the messaging. That is how Democrats will run in 2010. However, <a href=\"http://www.democracycorps.com/strategy/2008/12/the-president-elects-standing-now-and-1992/?section=Survey\">a Democracy Corps poll released today</a> shows that this legislation needs to be passed quickly and produce quick results. Otherwise, two years from now, the country won't still be overwhelmingly blaming Republicans if it doesn't:\r<p><blockquote>Q.32 Now I'm going to read you some pairs of statements. After I read each pair, please tell me whether the FIRST statement or the SECOND statement comes closer to your own view, even if neither is exactly right.<br />\r<p><i>32 (SPLIT A) I'm more concerned that Congress will prevent Barack Obama from making the kinds of changes he thinks are needed, by playing politics and catering too much to the special interests\r<br />OR\r<br />I'm more concerned that the Democratic Congress will be too much of a rubber stamp for Barack Obama, and will push through Obama's programs whether they are good or bad</i><br />\r<p>Agree first statement: 42%\r<br />Agree second statement: 49%\r<p>33 (SPLIT B) I'm more concerned that Republicans in Congress will obstruct Barack\r<br />Obama's agenda and prevent him from making the kinds of changes he thinks are needed.\r<br />OR\r<br />I'm more concerned that Democrats in Congress will be too much of a rubber stamp for Barack Obama, and will push through Obama's programs whether they are good or bad.<br />\r<p>Agree first statement: 43%\r<br />Agree second statement: 48%</blockquote>\r<p>So, last night's results and the Democracy Corps poll showed that the country isn't going to dump on Republicans forever. There is no grace period when the country will still vote for Democrats just because they hate Republicans. Democratic hopes in 2010 and 2012 rest entirely on our governing record during the next two to four years. Polling and election results show that Republican obstructionism will not be accepted as an excuse, and neither will be starting from the bottom of the deep hole Bush and Republicans dug for us. If we don't make things better, Republicans will immediately become competitive again, and the 2010-2012 political environment could be a lot more like 2000-2004 than 2005-2008.<br />\r<p>In two years time, simply being a Democrat will no longer good enough to be elected. We have been hired in huge numbers to solve problems without Republican interference. If we can't do that, then the country will sour on us, too. As such, the way back for Republicans is straightforward: hope that Democratic governance does not turn the country around.", "date_published": "2008-12-03 15:45:00", "link": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/OpenLeft-FrontPage/~3/473978176/showDiary.do", "date_updated": "2008-12-03 15:45:00"}}, {"pk": 2, "model": "feedinator.feedentry", "fields": {"feed": 1, "author_uri": null, "last_fetched": "2008-12-03 16:50:41", "uid": "http://www.openleft.com/showDiary.do?diaryId=10256", "title": "A Mass Psychological Change", "author_email": null, "author_name": "David Sirota", "summary": "What worries me about this moment is not whether Barack Obama will do good, progressive things.

If you read the blog here, or are familiar with Sunlight&#8217;s work, these problems will be very familiar:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bills are often dropped hours before a vote. With no time to read the bills, large programs get voted on with little review from lawmakers and no review from the public. In one egregious case, lawmakers went scurrying for information on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act amendments, legalizing domestic spying programs, as the final version of the bill was not available when the vote was held.</li>\n<li>Some committees are secret, some are open. Sometimes a bill can travel through multiple committees with varying degrees of transparency.</li>\n<li>Conference committees are supposed to be open, but openness is often circumvented or multiple conferences are held, some open, some not.</li>\n<li>Congressional Research Service reports, the information pipeline for most congressional offices, are not widely, publicly available.</li>\n<li>There is a large amount of over-classification of legislative activities related to defense and intelligence.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And so it goes. Congress still has leaps and bounds to make towards true transparency. Over the past two years, there have been some encouraging developments including the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act, the rewriting of franking restrictions for lawmaker web use, and the voluntary transparency of some individual lawmakers.</p>\n<p>One thing that does stand out in this article that needs to be challenged is the suggestion that transparency could cause greater disapproval of Congress:</p>\n<blockquote><p><span id=\"printableContent\">Lawmakers in the 1970s reasoned that more openness could benefit not just voters, but Congress itself. That isn\u2019t necessarily true, said Princeton\u2019s Zelizer, thanks to 19th Century German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck\u2019s saying that the two things no one should want to see being made are sausage and legislation.</span></p>\n<p>\u201cIt might not result in better ratings for Congress,\u201d the professor said. \u201cThey thought, \u2018If you make it more open, people will like it more.\u2019 That actually didn\u2019t happen.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>Zelizer, one of my favorite congressional experts, isn&#8217;t wrong here, but his lessons don&#8217;t necessarily apply to transparency as conceived of in the Internet-powered 21st century. While the reformers of the &#8217;60s and &#8217;70s did believe that openness would build trust with the public, they did not build interactivity and connectivity into that push for openness. Transparency, different from openness, proposes that information should not just be available and accessible, but that the public should be able to freely interact with both the information and all actors involved, including lawmakers, staffers, and other members of the general public. Unlike simply making information available, transparency would go a long way to help repair the image of Congress by actually connecting and involving citizens.</p>\n<p>To see what this transparency could look like read my colleague <a href=\"http://blog.sunlightfoundation.com/2008/12/03/yes-we-canuse-comments-web-services-on-government-web-sites/\">Greg Elin&#8217;s excellent</a> review of the interactivity at change.gov, the Obama-Biden Presidential Transition web site.</p>", "date_published": "2008-12-03 14:46:52", "link": "http://blog.sunlightfoundation.com/2008/12/03/the-secret-house-of-congress/", "date_updated": "2008-12-03 14:47:32"}}, {"pk": 3, "model": "feedinator.feedentry", "fields": {"feed": 1, "author_uri": null, "last_fetched": "2008-12-03 16:50:41", "uid": "http://www.openleft.com/showDiary.do?diaryId=10255", "title": "Joining The Impact - Musically Speaking", "author_email": null, "author_name": "Living Liberally", "summary": "<b><a href=\"http://www.laughingliberally.org\">Laughing Liberally</a> To Keep From Crying\r<br />by Josh Bolotsky</b>\r<p>Before we speak any further, watch this video - it will (probably) make your afternoon.

For example, about half of Americans who describe their political views as conservative say that all (24%) or some (27%) of the tax cuts passed under George W. Bush should be repealed.

Data supports this conclusion as well. <a href=\"http://www.harrisinteractive.com/harris_poll/index.asp?PID=860\">The long-term trends of the Harris poll</a> shows that ideological self-identification has changed little since 1978, with the percentage of \"conservative\" self-identifiers remaining between 34%-38% in all but two of the last 30 years, and with the percentage of \"liberal\" self-identifiers remaining between 17%-20% in all but one year. However, political scientist James Stimson shows that despite this apparently static national ideological mood, <a href=\"http://www.brendan-nyhan.com/blog/2007/03/why_the_public_.html\">the national inclination toward public policy</a> has actually shifted dramatically and frequently during the same time period:<br />\r<p><img width=\"500\" height=\"300\" src=\"http://www.openleft.com/upload/stimson.gif\" /><br />\r<p>Although it is more expedient in terms of public polling to simply ask people if they are liberals, moderates or conservatives, a more accurate reading would involve a battery of questions about general worldviews and specific policy inclinations. For example, the more accurate ideological reading of the electorate in the 2008 exit poll came not from the ideological self-identification question, but instead from the following <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/results/polls/#val=USP00p3\">classic public vs. private sector question</a>:<br />\r<p><b>View of Government</b>\r<br />Should do more: 51%\r<br />Should do less: 43%<br />\r<p>Although it leaves out cultural issues, that is about as straightforward an ideological positioning question as one can possibly ask. The result revealed a slightly center-left nation, quite different from the ideological self-identification question.<br />\r<p><i>2. The Rise of Progressives</i>\r<br />The last ten years has witnessed a marked rise in the use of a different left and center-left ideological term in America: progressive. This rise has been so pronounced and widespread that <a href=\"http://openleft.com/showDiary.do?diaryId=462\">\"progressive\" is now the most favorably viewed ideological term in America</a>, surpassing both \"moderate\" and \"conservative.\" <br />\r<p><a href=\"http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/current_events/general_current_events/labels_matter_progressive_better_than_liberal_reagan_like_better_than_conservative\">July 2007 Survey By Rasmussen Reports</a>\r<br /><table border=\"1\">\n<tr>\n<th>Label</th>\n<th>Positive View</th>\n<th>Negative View</th>\n<th>Net Favorable</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Progressive</td>\n<td>35%</td>\n<td>18%</td>\n<td>+17%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Moderate</td>\n<td>29%</td>\n<td>12%</td>\n<td>+17%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Conservative</td>\n<td>32%</td>\n<td>20%</td>\n<td>+12%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Liberal</td>\n<td>20%</td>\n<td>30%</td>\n<td>-10%</td>\n</tr></table>\r<br />There are now two competing ideological labels for the center-left and left in America, liberal and progressive. The chic term, \"progressive,\" is viewed far more favorably than \"liberal,\" but it is not offered as a choice in public opinion surveys or exit polls. Given the enormous difference in favorability ratings, it isn't even remotely a stretch to argue that more people would identify as a \"progressive\" than as a \"liberal\" if the term were offered in public opinion surveys. The absence of \"progressive\" in such surveys thus creates a false sense of a national ideological advantage for conservatives, as being a \"progressive\" is viewed more favorably than being a \"conservative.\"<br />\r<p><i>3. The Liberal Bradley Effect</i>\r<br />The third way ideological self-identification polling numbers skew toward conservatives is what I term the \"Liberal Bradley Effect.\" In terms of ideological self-identification, the gap between liberals and conservatives is always much smaller in Election Day exit polls than it is in national telephone polls. This indicates that people might feel less social pressure to identify as either conservative or moderate on Election Day than they do over the phone and in the abstract.<br />\r<p>For example, in <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/pages/results/states/US/P/00/epolls.0.html\">2000</a>, the conservative posted a 9% advantage on liberal in the exit poll, despite holding a 20% advantage that year according to <a href=\"http://pewresearch.org/pubs/1042/winds-of-political-change-havent--shifted-publics-ideology-balance\">Pew</a> and a 17% advantage that year in <a href=\"http://www.harrisinteractive.com/harris_poll/index.asp?PID=860\">Harris</a>. In <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/pages/results/states/US/P/00/epolls.0.html\">2004</a>, the exit poll gap was 13%, even though it was 18% in both Pew in Harris. In <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2006/pages/results/states/US/H/00/epolls.0.html\">2006</a>, the exit poll ideological gap was 12%, even though Harris pegged it at 18%. There are consistently more liberals, and fewer conservatives, on Election Day than in abstract telephone surveys. Given the negative public views of liberals noted in polling data above, it isn't a stretch to argue that this gap is the result of a \"Liberal Bradley Effect,\" where many people do not want to admit they are liberal, and many others claim they are conservative, in order to maintain public appearances.<br /> \r<p><i>Conclusion</i>\r<br />The direction of the national ideological shift was better described by a far more detailed survey undertaken by Pew two years ago. <a href=\"http://people-press.org/report/312/trends-in-political-values-and-core-attitudes-1987-2007\">The survey</a>, with topline results alone more than 100 pages in length and supported by more than twenty years of data, identified a leftward ideological drift in America:\r<p><blockquote>Increased public support for the social safety net, signs of growing public concern about income inequality, and a diminished appetite for assertive national security policies have improved the political landscape for the Democrats as the 2008 presidential campaign gets underway.<br />\r<p>At the same time, many of the key trends that nurtured the Republican resurgence in the mid-1990s have moderated, according to Pew's longitudinal measures of the public's basic political, social and economic values. The proportion of Americans who support traditional social values has edged downward since 1994, while the proportion of Americans expressing strong personal religious commitment also has declined modestly.</blockquote>\r<p>Pew will release another one of these detailed \"core values\" surveys early in 2009. At that point, we will be able to determine if this leftward drift has continued, accelerated, or reversed. Until that time, try to avoid looking at ideological self-identification numbers, as they are a particularly poor measurement of the national ideological mood.", "content": "Pew recently releases <a href=\"http://pewresearch.org/pubs/1042/winds-of-political-change-havent--shifted-publics-ideology-balance\">a much-discussed survey</a> arguing that, despite massive partisan gains for Democrats, the ideological balance of the country has not shifted much.

In <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2006/pages/results/states/US/H/00/epolls.0.html\">2006</a>, the exit poll ideological gap was 12%, even though Harris pegged it at 18%. There are consistently more liberals, and fewer conservatives, on Election Day than in abstract telephone surveys. Given the negative public views of liberals noted in polling data above, it isn't a stretch to argue that this gap is the result of a \"Liberal Bradley Effect,\" where many people do not want to admit they are liberal, and many others claim they are conservative, in order to maintain public appearances.<br /> \r<p><i>Conclusion</i>\r<br />The direction of the national ideological shift was better described by a far more detailed survey undertaken by Pew two years ago. <a href=\"http://people-press.org/report/312/trends-in-political-values-and-core-attitudes-1987-2007\">The survey</a>, with topline results alone more than 100 pages in length and supported by more than twenty years of data, identified a leftward ideological drift in America:\r<p><blockquote>Increased public support for the social safety net, signs of growing public concern about income inequality, and a diminished appetite for assertive national security policies have improved the political landscape for the Democrats as the 2008 presidential campaign gets underway.<br />\r<p>At the same time, many of the key trends that nurtured the Republican resurgence in the mid-1990s have moderated, according to Pew's longitudinal measures of the public's basic political, social and economic values. The proportion of Americans who support traditional social values has edged downward since 1994, while the proportion of Americans expressing strong personal religious commitment also has declined modestly.</blockquote>\r<p>Pew will release another one of these detailed \"core values\" surveys early in 2009. At that point, we will be able to determine if this leftward drift has continued, accelerated, or reversed. Until that time, try to avoid looking at ideological self-identification numbers, as they are a particularly poor measurement of the national ideological mood.", "date_published": "2008-12-03 13:00:45", "link": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/OpenLeft-FrontPage/~3/473853013/showDiary.do", "date_updated": "2008-12-03 13:00:45"}}, {"pk": 44, "model": "feedinator.feedentry", "fields": {"feed": 5, "author_uri": null, "last_fetched": "2008-12-03 16:56:23", "uid": "http://firedoglake.com/2008/12/03/erick-erickson-dances-in-end-zone-after-late-field-goal-by-saxby-chambliss-makes-final-score-48-3/", "title": "Erick Erickson Dances In End Zone After Late Field Goal By Saxby Chambliss Makes Final Score 48-3.", "author_email": null, "author_name": "Blue Texan", "summary": "Pathetic, thy name is Red State.", "content": "<p><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3287/3076627941_d0605b708a_m.jpg\" alt=\"3076627941_d0605b708a_m.jpg\" align=\"right\" height=\"173\" width=\"240\" />Pathetic, thy name is <a href=\"http://www.redstate.com/diaries/redstate/2008/dec/02/congratulations-sarah-palin-and-saxby/\">Red State.</a> </p>\n<blockquote><div class=\"wbq\"><p>Both Sarah Palin and Barack Obama campaigned in Georgia.

Cabinet secretaries and White House policy advisers who actually craft policy) are almost all right-of-center, Establishment choices - and almost none are, as <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/blogs/jstreet/385427/left_out?rel=hpbox\">The Nation's Chris Hayes</a> has said, movement progressives. At the same time, many Obama appointments to exclusively <em>political</em> positions - that is, positions that are focused on selling policy, whatever that policy may be - are terrific movement progressives, people like Mike Lux (transition outreach to progressive orgs), Ellen Moran (communications director), Phil Schiliro (congressional liason) and Patrick Gaspard (political director). In other words, the initial structure seems to resemble the principle in American politics of politicians publicly selling their policies in progressive terms, while having those policies be crafted with much more conservative ideology. </p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>The question remains, Sirota noted, as to how they will function together.  Will the political people have any power of their own, or will they merely be considered pitchmen who are supposed to make bitter conservative pills easier for progressives to swallow?</p>\n<p>We got to see the machinery in action yesterday, when Pach <a href=\"http://firedoglake.com/2008/12/02/will-a-president-obama-fight-for-the-employee-free-choice-act/\">wrote a post</a> about his inquiry to the progressive pitchmen asking for confirmation about Obama's commitment to the Employee Free Choice Act after Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel did not mention it as one of the administration's priorities and implied that they might be willing to trade it for health care.  </p>\n<p>The spokespeople said that they weren't empowered to respond.</p>\n<p>Yet today, a statement was given to Sam Stein of <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/12/03/obama-team-restates-stron_n_147939.html\">the Huffington Post</a> confirming  Team Obama's commitment to Employee Free Choice.  </p>\n<p>It appears that even though the progressive &quot;handlers&quot; have no power, the question Pach publicly asked reverberated at a level that someone thought it demanded an answer.</p>\n<p>And in the process, questions asked by Boyce and Sirota got answered too, I think.</p>", "date_published": "2008-12-03 12:04:17", "link": "http://firedoglake.com/2008/12/03/the-power-of-the-blogs-vs-the-power-of-the-press/", "date_updated": "2008-12-03 12:04:17"}}, {"pk": 46, "model": "feedinator.feedentry", "fields": {"feed": 5, "author_uri": null, "last_fetched": "2008-12-03 16:56:23", "uid": "http://firedoglake.com/2008/12/03/grittv-live-truth-and-reconciliation-at-home/", "title": "GRITtv live: Truth and Reconciliation at Home", "author_email": null, "author_name": "GRITtv", "summary": "Moving on from the crimes of the Bush administration is not possible, writes Scott Horton in the current issue of Harper's.

Dean grew up in East Hampton on Long Island and on Park Avenue. &nbsp;Yet he turned his back on a financial career, went to medical school and became a family doctor in Vermont along with his wife Judith Steinberg. &nbsp;He's the Park Avenue version of the hippy who went up country. &nbsp;Yet his life and his career flourished. &nbsp;He was elected to the Vermont legislature after getting involved in local politics as part of a coalition looking to get a bike path built along Lake Champlain. &nbsp;He was elected Lt. Governor in 1986 and reelected Governor 5 times (becoming the second longest serving Vermont Governor in Vermont history) after stepping into the role after the death of Governor Richard Snelling. &nbsp;He created the first mass political movement using Internet technologies. &nbsp;And he transformed party politics by transferring power to the state and local parties. \r<p>In a thirty-year period dominated by an insane reverse wealth transfer, and in which the excesses of the financial elite threaten to crater the capitalist system without massive risk socialization by the federal government, Dean has stood out at as a critic of D.C. centered politics and elite domination of the federal government. &nbsp; Think about it; a person who began their career in politics fighting to get a bike path built is at the gates of the highest levels of government. &nbsp;A presidential candidate who stuffs his suit pockets with chocolate chip cookies, a guy who directs his staffer to go left rather than right at a house party so he can get another shot at the M&M; bowl. &nbsp;A real person, a small d democrat, who viscerally understands the American elite because he was once part of it, rises to national leadership and pushes power back into the grassroots and the state parties. \r<p>The personal threat that Dean poses to elite rule is compounded by his rise through Vermont politics. &nbsp;Vermont doesn't just talk about bipartisanship and use it as a cover for sample sales of the country's assets by elite politicians and financiers; they practice it in their electoral politics. &nbsp;In the last twenty years Vermonters have elected a classic Yankee Republican (Jim Jeffords), a scrappy Brooklyn born socialist (Bernie Sanders) and a scion of Park Avenue wealth turned family doctor (Howard Dean) as their statewide representatives. &nbsp;\r<p>These new Green Mountain Boys have a people and community orientation that comes out of Vermont's tradition of direct democracy through the town meeting. &nbsp;Howard Dean's fifty state strategy is in essence an extension of the practice of direct democracy to party politics and electoral organizing. &nbsp; And it scares the hell out of the D.C. regulars and the corporate elites. &nbsp; It takes us beyond the culture of the expert --- the serious foreign policy expert from the northeast corridor, the Yale graduate organizing on behalf of janitors, Wall Street bankers trying to fix a system they broke --- to organizations and coalitions of ordinary people choosing leaders and solving problems on their own. &nbsp; It harnesses the new communication technologies to spread power and enable real conversations between those on the ground and those back in a state capital, D.C., or elsewhere. &nbsp; \r<p>For the D.C. and corporate elites, this model of direct democratic movement politics is very dangerous indeed. \r<p>David Sirota had a very penetrating insight into the marginalization of progressives in matters of economic and foreign policy during the Obama transition:\r<p><blockquote>What I mean to say is that we live in a culture that now organizes around celebrity - and Obama knew it, and knew that lots of left organizations aren't really ideological - they are, if anything, organized around the Democratic Party and Bush hatred. So he basically figured out that if he could become a celebrity - and a Democratic Bush-hating one - he could swallow up a huge part of the \"progressive infrastructure\" and organize it around him (and all the hateful \"if you question Obama, you hate Obama\" comments that will inevitably be at the bottom of this diary actually confirm this!).

Dean grew up in East Hampton on Long Island and on Park Avenue. &nbsp;Yet he turned his back on a financial career, went to medical school and became a family doctor in Vermont along with his wife Judith Steinberg. &nbsp;He's the Park Avenue version of the hippy who went up country. &nbsp;Yet his life and his career flourished. &nbsp;He was elected to the Vermont legislature after getting involved in local politics as part of a coalition looking to get a bike path built along Lake Champlain. &nbsp;He was elected Lt. Governor in 1986 and reelected Governor 5 times (becoming the second longest serving Vermont Governor in Vermont history) after stepping into the role after the death of Governor Richard Snelling. &nbsp;He created the first mass political movement using Internet technologies. &nbsp;And he transformed party politics by transferring power to the state and local parties. \r<p>In a thirty-year period dominated by an insane reverse wealth transfer, and in which the excesses of the financial elite threaten to crater the capitalist system without massive risk socialization by the federal government, Dean has stood out at as a critic of D.C. centered politics and elite domination of the federal government. &nbsp; Think about it; a person who began their career in politics fighting to get a bike path built is at the gates of the highest levels of government. &nbsp;A presidential candidate who stuffs his suit pockets with chocolate chip cookies, a guy who directs his staffer to go left rather than right at a house party so he can get another shot at the M&M; bowl. &nbsp;A real person, a small d democrat, who viscerally understands the American elite because he was once part of it, rises to national leadership and pushes power back into the grassroots and the state parties. \r<p>The personal threat that Dean poses to elite rule is compounded by his rise through Vermont politics. &nbsp;Vermont doesn't just talk about bipartisanship and use it as a cover for sample sales of the country's assets by elite politicians and financiers; they practice it in their electoral politics. &nbsp;In the last twenty years Vermonters have elected a classic Yankee Republican (Jim Jeffords), a scrappy Brooklyn born socialist (Bernie Sanders) and a scion of Park Avenue wealth turned family doctor (Howard Dean) as their statewide representatives. &nbsp;\r<p>These new Green Mountain Boys have a people and community orientation that comes out of Vermont's tradition of direct democracy through the town meeting. &nbsp;Howard Dean's fifty state strategy is in essence an extension of the practice of direct democracy to party politics and electoral organizing. &nbsp; And it scares the hell out of the D.C. regulars and the corporate elites. &nbsp; It takes us beyond the culture of the expert --- the serious foreign policy expert from the northeast corridor, the Yale graduate organizing on behalf of janitors, Wall Street bankers trying to fix a system they broke --- to organizations and coalitions of ordinary people choosing leaders and solving problems on their own. &nbsp; It harnesses the new communication technologies to spread power and enable real conversations between those on the ground and those back in a state capital, D.C., or elsewhere. &nbsp; \r<p>For the D.C. and corporate elites, this model of direct democratic movement politics is very dangerous indeed. \r<p>David Sirota had a very penetrating insight into the marginalization of progressives in matters of economic and foreign policy during the Obama transition:\r<p><blockquote>What I mean to say is that we live in a culture that now organizes around celebrity - and Obama knew it, and knew that lots of left organizations aren't really ideological - they are, if anything, organized around the Democratic Party and Bush hatred. So he basically figured out that if he could become a celebrity - and a Democratic Bush-hating one - he could swallow up a huge part of the \"progressive infrastructure\" and organize it around him (and all the hateful \"if you question Obama, you hate Obama\" comments that will inevitably be at the bottom of this diary actually confirm this!). And we shouldn't blame him for being a \"celebrity\" - it's not an epithet. And we shouldn't blame him for seizing his moment. Not at all. \r<p>This, by the way, is very different from the Reagan model. Reagan was a telegenic, for sure - but he was a product of a movement. In the age of celebrity worship - the age where we literally organize AROUND celebrity - Obama is a movement unto himself. </blockquote>\r<p><a href=\"http://www.openleft.com/showDiary.do?diaryId=10094\">Obama Ate the Left</a>\r<p>This continues to be a problem for progressive politics in the United States. &nbsp;We continue to lack a real movement or institutional structure. &nbsp;Unfortunately in many communities, progressive politics and institutions stand outside the fabric of everyday life. &nbsp;There are exceptions of course, but it is rare to find in suburban, exurban and rural communities organizations or institutions that can easily serve as a rallying point for progressive candidates, politics and ideas. \r<p>Howard Dean actually addressed this issue by transferring power and budgets to the state and local parties. &nbsp;The end result was back-to-back wave elections, wins in unexpected places like Mississippi and the revitalization of some state parties. &nbsp; &nbsp;\r<p>The famous question \"What do we do now\" is taking on an increasing urgency for progressives as folks like Timothy Geithner and Larry Summers are appointed to Treasury and to Senior White House posts and the architects of the democratic resurgence are cast into the wilderness. &nbsp; If the auto industry is allowed to collapse after this last Citigroup bailout, this Democratic resurgence architected by Howard Dean will be quite short lived. \r<p>The challenge over the next 12-18 months is to build new networks of state and local power that don't rely on the Democratic National Committee or other D.C. based institutions. &nbsp;Howard Dean showed us the way and used the DNC to further state and local politics. &nbsp;We now need to take his model and build independent institutions and funding sources that forward the vision of direct democracy. \r<p>The establishment hates Howard Dean. &nbsp;We can turn the tables by showing them that we do indeed have the power. \r<p>Cross posted at <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/www.boomantribune.com\">Booman Tribune</a>", "date_published": "2008-12-03 11:05:50", "link": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/OpenLeft-FrontPage/~3/473737898/showDiary.do", "date_updated": "2008-12-03 11:05:50"}}, {"pk": 47, "model": "feedinator.feedentry", "fields": {"feed": 5, "author_uri": null, "last_fetched": "2008-12-03 16:56:23", "uid": "http://firedoglake.com/2008/12/03/obama-transition-reaffirms-commitment-to-employee-free-choice-act/", "title": "Obama Transition Reaffirms Commitment to Employee Free Choice Act", "author_email": null, "author_name": "Pachacutec", "summary": "Yesterday I wrote of my attempts to get the Obama team on the record to reaffirm its support for the Employee Free Choice Act after Rahm Emanuel demurred on the question when asked.

Bernanke's Depression history expertise doesn't make him infallible.  </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Then, I read <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/12/02/AR2008120202219.html?hpid=topnews\">this from a GAO report</a>: </p>\n<blockquote><div class=\"wbq\"><p>...the Treasury Department has yet to impose necessary internal controls or decide how to determine if the bailout program is achieving its goals. The auditors said it was too soon for them to tell whether the bailout was working.</p>\n<p>&quot;Without a strong oversight and monitoring function, Treasury's ability to help ensure an appropriate level of accountability and transparency will be limited....&quot;</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>Well...<a href=\"http://firedoglake.com/2008/12/02/bailout-monitor-sez-treasury-has-no-effin-clue/\">duh</a>.  Who could <a href=\"http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2008/12/2/1063/07124/764/668440\">possibly have forseen</a> a need for transparency and oversight of billions of taxpayer dollars being handed over to failing businesses in an economic crunch caused by waste, fraudulent behavior, poor business decisions, the gutting of regulations and worse?  <em>(Yes, I am rolling my eyes...why do you ask?)  </em></p>\n<p>What is Treasury doing?  They <a href=\"http://voices.washingtonpost.com/federal-eye/2008/12/plenty_of_questions_remain_abo.html\">are staffing up</a>.  They are <a href=\"http://www.eschatonblog.com/2008_11_30_archive.html#6514727846658238834\">trying to gin up</a> ways to hand over more taxpayer money.  But accountability?

And some of them might be breaking the new ethics rules that Majority Leader Steny Hoyer stated there would be a \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy. The <a href=\"http://www.nypost.com/seven/11302008/news/regionalnews/shady_island_house_party_141513.htm?page=0\">New York Post</a> has an expos\u00e9 on a privately paid trip (not everyone stopped taking them) to the Caribbean island of St. Maarten taken by six members of the Congressional Black Caucus. The Post accuses the lawmakers of accepting travel from an entity that employs a lobbyist, going on a trip that included lobbyists, and failing to properly file their disclosures.</p>\n<p>Officially the trip was sponsored by the Carib News Foundation for a conference in St. Maarten. The Foundation, however, accepts contributions from corporate sponsors, some just for the Foundation\u2019s operations and others specifically for the conference. These corporate sponsors included Citigroup, AT&amp;T, Verizon, Pfizer, Macy&#8217;s, and American Airlines. Since, ethics rules forbid the acceptance of travel from an entity that employs a lobbyist, and all of these companies employ lobbyists, the question is whether a sponsor of the Carib News Foundation and their conference needs to be listed as a sponsor of the trip. This is the primary question at the center of possible ethics violations.</p>\n<p>According to the Post, the Foundation, in filling out the proper disclosure forms, checked the box, &#8220;I represent that the trip sponsor(s) has not accepted from any other source funds earmarked directly or indirectly to finance any aspect of the trip.&#8221; This statement is not properly backed up by statements made by Carib News Foundation CEO Karl Rodney and representatives of the corporate sponsors:</p>\n<blockquote><p>[I]n his opening remarks in St. Maarten, Rodney, who has organized 13 annual conferences, thanked all of the corporate sponsors by name.</p>\n<p>He expressed gratitude to AT&amp;T for its sponsorship at all prior conferences and singled out Citigroup as being the biggest conference sponsor this year.</p>\n<p>&#8220;And so we want to say thanks to Citi,&#8221; said Rodney. &#8220;It&#8217;s a great team to have working, and great partners.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Citigroup Vice President Michael Flanigan, who attended the St. Maarten event and is listed as a member of the conference planning committee, didn&#8217;t try to hide his company&#8217;s association with the event during a speech he gave to attendees.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This year was significant for Citi,&#8221; Flanigan said, speaking to a half-full room. &#8220;For the first time we are the lead sponsor of this premier event.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://ethics.house.gov/Subjects/Topics.aspx?Section=96\">House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct</a> states that:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8230;when a nonprofit organization pays for travel with donations that were earmarked, either formally or informally, for the trip, each such donor is deemed a \u201cprivate source\u201d for the trip and (1) must be publicly disclosed as a trip sponsor on the applicable travel forms and (2) must itself be required to satisfy the above standards on proper sources of travel expenses.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It appears, through the indirect admission of Rodney and corporate representatives, that corporate funds were used to finance the conference. The question remains as to whether the conference counts as part of \u201cthe trip.\u201d Rodney states that the Foundation funds 50% of the conference, and it is possible that all the funds earmarked for the lawmaker trips came from the Foundation\u2019s coffers. The <a href=\"http://ethics.house.gov/Subjects/Topics.aspx?Section=96\">Committee</a> has further rules relating to the involvement of corporate sponsors:</p>\n<blockquote><p>[I]n order for a Member or staff person to receive Committee approval to accept officially-connected travel from a private source, the source must certify to the Committee that it has not accepted from any other source funds earmarked directly or indirectly to finance any aspect of the trip</p></blockquote>\n<p>\u201c[A]ny aspect of the trip\u201d certainly sounds as though the conference would count as part of the trip. Looking at the definitions in another disputed matter of ethics violations in the Post story puts doubt into what could define a \u201ctrip\u201d or \u201caspect of [a] trip\u201d.</p>\n<p>The Post also points out that the presence of lobbyists at the conference may violate the rules banning lawmakers from accepting travel in which lobbyists accompany them. The use of simple language is where legal loopholes are born. And this is <a href=\"http://ethics.house.gov/Subjects/Topics.aspx?Section=96\">no exception</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In addition to prohibiting Members and staff from accepting officially-connected travel from a private source that retains or employs lobbyists or agents of a foreign principal, for most trips the travel provisions of the gift rule prohibit Members and staff from accepting travel from a private source if the official will be accompanied by a lobbyist or agent of a foreign principal on \u201cany segment\u201d of the trip (House Rule 25, clause 5(c)(1)(A)).  The term \u201csegment\u201d means any part(s) of the travel to and from the destination, rather than the event itself or location being visited that is the purpose of the trip.  Whether a lobbyist may be involved in planning, organizing, requesting, or arranging a trip also depends on the source of the travel expenses.</p></blockquote>\n<p>So there you go. A \u201csegment\u201d does not include the segment of the trip that includes the purpose of the trip. If a \u201csegment\u201d of a trip is only defined by the coming and going part of \u201ctrip,\u201d does this extend to \u201cany aspect\u201d of said trip? Doubtfully, considering the sponsor, the Foundation, is paying not just for airfare, but for food and lodging.</p>\n<p>This trip is certainly a case of questionable twisting of ethics rules, if not an outright violation. The loopholes evident make the restrictions placed on privately paid travel easy to circumnavigate, and thus ought to addressed.</p>", "date_published": "2008-12-02 18:43:21", "link": "http://blog.sunlightfoundation.com/2008/12/02/caribbean-island-trip-and-ethics-loopholes/", "date_updated": "2008-12-02 18:43:21"}}, {"pk": 14, "model": "feedinator.feedentry", "fields": {"feed": 2, "author_uri": null, "last_fetched": "2008-12-03 16:50:42", "uid": "http://www.thenextright.com/3302 at http://www.thenextright.com", "title": "One Small Step for the Right", "author_email": null, "author_name": "mindyfinn", "summary": "<p><em>To echo and build on </em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.thenextright.com/patrick-ruffini/i-got-yer-ideology-right-here\"><em>Patrick's post</em></a><em>. </em></p>\n<p>When a few of us channeled our efforts to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.RebuildtheParty.com\">RebuildtheParty.com</a>, we intended to jumpstart the conversation about what the Party must do from a tactical standpoint to rebuild.&nbsp;

In fact, it&rsquo;s a gargantuan challenge, and one that should not be left in the hands of the entrenched consultant class of the last decade, the conservative movement dead wood (as <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.redstate.com/diaries/redstate/2008/dec/02/thoughts-rebuilding-dead-wood/\">Erick Erickson</a> calls them) and purely self-promotional politicians.&nbsp;

We did not intend to provide an all-encompassing manifesto that will guarantee a renewed Republican majority. </p>\n<p>Our philosophy: rather than sit around and meet behind closed doors or wait for the perfect plan, let&rsquo;s get started right away making changes within the party infrastructure.&nbsp; </p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s impact the conversations about what the Party must do to rebuild.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s ensure, as a start, that the next Republican National Committee Chairman sets the right tone from a tactical perspective.&nbsp; Most importantly, let&rsquo;s open up the process so that we, the Republican people, have a say in electing our next Party Chairman. </p>\n<p>If we, or anyone, had a precise, complete roadmap for what the Party must do from an ideological or policy perspective, what would we have left to talk about on sites like this one?&nbsp;

In fact, it&rsquo;s a gargantuan challenge, and one that should not be left in the hands of the entrenched consultant class of the last decade, the conservative movement dead wood (as <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.redstate.com/diaries/redstate/2008/dec/02/thoughts-rebuilding-dead-wood/\">Erick Erickson</a> calls them) and purely self-promotional politicians.&nbsp;

Debate is good. -Patrick</em></p>\n<p>Last week, my friend Jon Henke wrote <a href=\"http://www.thenextright.com/jon-henke/rebuild-the-right-no-longer-the-party-of-ideas\">a post</a> criticizing Heritage President Ed Feulner and more broadly the entire conservative movement (full disclosure: Dr. Feulner is my boss, but in this post I write only for myself and am representing my own views) . </p>\n<p>As you might have guessed, I have to take issue with Jon. While he makes some valid points (as always), I still think he goes too far on a couple. </p>\n<p>First, Jon argues that the personnel of the Republican Party apparatus is composed of movement conservatives. As someone who spent a good deal of time working in the Senate, I am surprised that he would make that argument. </p>\n<p>I think Jon and I are both painfully aware of some the types of staffers who have clawed their way to the top throughout the beltway-Party infrastructure. In many instances, these are people who have openly disdained us and our ideas. Far too many of them desperately cling to power for power&rsquo;s sake. And far too many of them wouldn&rsquo;t know a great, principled policy idea if it smacked them in the face. </p>\n<p>To say that the conservative movement should bear responsibility in that arena is something I vehemently disagree with. I mean heck, as a staffer for Jim DeMint over the better part of the last two years, I saw first hand how the good Senator repeatedly went toe to toe with GOP establishment and received <a href=\"http://www.redstate.com/diaries/erick/2008/nov/21/the-gops-senator-problem/\">nothing but scorn for it</a> &ndash; from staffers and senators alike.</p>\n<p>And for Heritage&rsquo;s part, they have been in the battle every step of the way. But frankly, since Heritage got banned from then-Majority Leader Tom DeLay&rsquo;s office back in 2003 over our opposition to the prescription drug bill, it has been an adversarial relationship most of the way. And that is as it should be given the makeup of the Party right now. </p>\n<p>This adversarial relationship has continued to manifest itself over the years. Whether it be on immigration reform, Harriet Miers, No Child Left Behind or Bridges to Nowhere, Heritage and the broader movement have stood opposed to the powers that be &ndash; both elected and unelected &ndash; in the Republican Party. </p>\n<p>That leads to my second gripe. Jon says we need to push the reset button on ideas. Look, I am somewhat susceptible to this argument. I liked parts of David Frum&rsquo;s book <em>Comeback</em>, I read Brooks regularly and can even stomach some Douthat on occasion. I certainly don&rsquo;t agree with all that these guys are pushing, but I love the outside the box thinking <em>when</em> and <em>if</em> it advances the cause. But it is, in my opinion, unfair to write a post that portrays Ed Feulner and the Heritage Foundation as a group lacking ideas. </p>\n<p>Stuart Butler, Heritage&rsquo;s Domestic Policy VP, has been the national leader in pushing the idea of a revamped employer-based health system as the alternative to Obamacare as well as a major reform of the tax treatment of health care &ndash; a proposal that would achieve equity while empowering those without employer coverage. Who knows? Heritage&rsquo;s persistence may even yield successes under our new liberal overlords. The rest of our health care team have been effective as well in pushing &ldquo;transformational&rdquo; ideas as evidenced by nearly all the major candidates adopting some form of our proposal. </p>\n<p>Or take entitlements. Heritage convinced the top people at left-leaning Brookings and Urban Institute to seriously address this issue. It was Heritage who argued for a transformation in the budget process to &ldquo;end entitlements as we know them&rdquo; by putting Medicare, Medicaid, etc. on to the same budget basis as defense. </p>\n<p>These are ideas that are, as Jon says, &ldquo;transformational&rdquo; and they would be enormously beneficial to the country if acted upon.</p>\n<p>There is plenty more.</p>\n<p>The problem has not been within the idea incubators, it has been with the politicians who either cannot explain their position, or frankly don&rsquo;t have the heart and the passion to advance the idea. We make ideas, we don&rsquo;t coach politicians. Not in our job description. </p>\n<p>Finally, Jon ends with a call to &ldquo;reset the movement&rdquo; and develop a new guard to &ldquo;compete&rdquo; with the old guard.

Debate is good. -Patrick</em></p>\n<p>Last week, my friend Jon Henke wrote <a href=\"http://www.thenextright.com/jon-henke/rebuild-the-right-no-longer-the-party-of-ideas\">a post</a> criticizing Heritage President Ed Feulner and more broadly the entire conservative movement (full disclosure: Dr. Feulner is my boss, but in this post I write only for myself and am representing my own views) . </p>\n<p>As you might have guessed, I have to take issue with Jon. While he makes some valid points (as always), I still think he goes too far on a couple. </p>\n<p>First, Jon argues that the personnel of the Republican Party apparatus is composed of movement conservatives. As someone who spent a good deal of time working in the Senate, I am surprised that he would make that argument. </p>\n<p>I think Jon and I are both painfully aware of some the types of staffers who have clawed their way to the top throughout the beltway-Party infrastructure. In many instances, these are people who have openly disdained us and our ideas. Far too many of them desperately cling to power for power&rsquo;s sake. And far too many of them wouldn&rsquo;t know a great, principled policy idea if it smacked them in the face. </p>\n<p>To say that the conservative movement should bear responsibility in that arena is something I vehemently disagree with. I mean heck, as a staffer for Jim DeMint over the better part of the last two years, I saw first hand how the good Senator repeatedly went toe to toe with GOP establishment and received <a href=\"http://www.redstate.com/diaries/erick/2008/nov/21/the-gops-senator-problem/\">nothing but scorn for it</a> &ndash; from staffers and senators alike.</p>\n<p>And for Heritage&rsquo;s part, they have been in the battle every step of the way. But frankly, since Heritage got banned from then-Majority Leader Tom DeLay&rsquo;s office back in 2003 over our opposition to the prescription drug bill, it has been an adversarial relationship most of the way. And that is as it should be given the makeup of the Party right now. </p>\n<p>This adversarial relationship has continued to manifest itself over the years. Whether it be on immigration reform, Harriet Miers, No Child Left Behind or Bridges to Nowhere, Heritage and the broader movement have stood opposed to the powers that be &ndash; both elected and unelected &ndash; in the Republican Party. </p>\n<p>That leads to my second gripe. Jon says we need to push the reset button on ideas. Look, I am somewhat susceptible to this argument. I liked parts of David Frum&rsquo;s book <em>Comeback</em>, I read Brooks regularly and can even stomach some Douthat on occasion. I certainly don&rsquo;t agree with all that these guys are pushing, but I love the outside the box thinking <em>when</em> and <em>if</em> it advances the cause. But it is, in my opinion, unfair to write a post that portrays Ed Feulner and the Heritage Foundation as a group lacking ideas. </p>\n<p>Stuart Butler, Heritage&rsquo;s Domestic Policy VP, has been the national leader in pushing the idea of a revamped employer-based health system as the alternative to Obamacare as well as a major reform of the tax treatment of health care &ndash; a proposal that would achieve equity while empowering those without employer coverage. Who knows? Heritage&rsquo;s persistence may even yield successes under our new liberal overlords. The rest of our health care team have been effective as well in pushing &ldquo;transformational&rdquo; ideas as evidenced by nearly all the major candidates adopting some form of our proposal. </p>\n<p>Or take entitlements. Heritage convinced the top people at left-leaning Brookings and Urban Institute to seriously address this issue. It was Heritage who argued for a transformation in the budget process to &ldquo;end entitlements as we know them&rdquo; by putting Medicare, Medicaid, etc. on to the same budget basis as defense. </p>\n<p>These are ideas that are, as Jon says, &ldquo;transformational&rdquo; and they would be enormously beneficial to the country if acted upon.</p>\n<p>There is plenty more.</p>\n<p>The problem has not been within the idea incubators, it has been with the politicians who either cannot explain their position, or frankly don&rsquo;t have the heart and the passion to advance the idea. We make ideas, we don&rsquo;t coach politicians. Not in our job description. </p>\n<p>Finally, Jon ends with a call to &ldquo;reset the movement&rdquo; and develop a new guard to &ldquo;compete&rdquo; with the old guard. We are conservatives, not revolutionaries. We do not reset. Conservatives build on the past by identifying what has worked and discarding what has not. We stand on the shoulders of giants and we yes, we must train up the next generation. Edmund Burke said the true mark of a statesman is the disposition to preserve and the ability to improve.

His weekly addresses on YouTube, the interactive health care discussion he&#8217;s hosting on Change.gov, and his decision over the weekend to place all content on Change.gov under the freest Creative Commons license, all indicate that he&#8217;s serious about implementing the technology ideas that he spoke about during his campaign.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>As the Obama-Biden Transition Team is settling in and establishing the tone of their operation, we&#8217;ve joined a host of other open government advocates &#8211; including <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/\">Mozilla</a>, <a href=\"http://change-congress.org/\">Change Congress</a>, <a href=\"http://eff.org/\"><span class=\"caps\">EFF</span></a>, and our sister organization, <a href=\"http://www.pculture.org/\"><span class=\"caps\">PCF</span></a> &#8211; in sending them a letter to encourage them to take a few more crucial steps towards being truly open.  For example, while posting videos on YouTube is a step towards integrating government information into the flow of culture, the platform doesn&#8217;t allow users to download videos so they can be remixed and used in new ways.</p>\n\n\n\t<p><a href=\"http://open-government.us/\">Click here to read the letter and to sign on</a>.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Here&#8217;s the abbreviated version of the three principles we&#8217;re asking that the Transition Team and the new government apply to their use of the Internet every step of the way:</p>\n\n\n\t<p>1. <strong>No Legal Barrier to Sharing</strong> &#8211; Content made publicly available in the course of this transition \u2014 such as President-elect Obama\u2019s videos, or policy statements posted on the change.gov website \u2014 should be freely licensed so that citizens can share, excerpt, remix or otherwise redistribute this content without unnecessary complexity imposed by the law.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>2. <strong>No Technological Barrier to Sharing</strong> &#8211; A merely legal freedom to share and remix, however, can be thwarted by technological constraints. Content made publicly available should also be freely accessible, not blocked by technological barriers. Citizens should be able to download transition-related content in a way that makes it simple to share, excerpt, remix, or redistribute. This is an essential digital freedom.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>3. <strong>Free Competition</strong> &#8211; Governments should remain neutral in the marketplace of ideas. Transition-generated content should thus not be made publicly available in a way that unfairly benefits one commercial entity over another, or commercial entities over noncommercial entities.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Please join us by <a href=\"http://open-government.us/\">signing on to these principles</a>.</p>    <img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/OpenCongressCongressGossipBlog/~4/472829426\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" />", "date_published": "2008-12-02 08:24:00", "link": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/OpenCongressCongressGossipBlog/~3/472829426/769-Open-Government-3-Principles-for-the-Obama-Administration", "date_updated": "2008-12-02 08:24:00"}}, {"pk": 16, "model": "feedinator.feedentry", "fields": {"feed": 2, "author_uri": null, "last_fetched": "2008-12-03 16:50:43", "uid": "http://www.thenextright.com/3289 at http://www.thenextright.com", "title": "I Got Yer Ideology Right Here", "author_email": null, "author_name": "Patrick Ruffini", "summary": "<p>&quot;The Democratic Strategist&quot; Ed Kilgore <a href=\"http://www.thedemocraticstrategist.org/strategist/2008/12/the_gop_and_two_democratic_ref.php\">critiques</a> the <a href=\"http://www.rebuildtheparty.com/plan\">Rebuild the Party plan:</a>&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote><p>And as you may also know, most of the participants in this debate begin by asserting that the problems of the GOP are not fundamentally ideological, or if they are, it's just a matter of<a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1108/15980.html\" class=\"stratigestlinks\"> insufficient conservatism, or insufficient consistency</a>.

For perspective's sake, just consider that from 2000 to 2004, the electorate expanded by 16% -- and the country voted 3 points more Republican.</p>\n<p>As I wrote in <a href=\"http://www.thenextright.com/patrick-ruffini/the-straight-ticket-youth-vote\">The Straight-Ticket Youth Vote</a>, the identity politics vote based on Obama's personal characteristics -- young and African-American -- may have counted for as much as 6 points of his victory margin -- about 4 points in the increased youth margin and turnout, and about 2 points in increased African American turnout and margin. Not only did this benefit Obama but young people also voted straight ticket for Democratic Congressional candidates. The youth vote on November 4th was about as Democratic as the Latino vote -- and twice as large.</p>\n<p>Those advantages are not going to be at play for Jim Martin, a boring white guy.</p>\n<p>It's in Georgia that we may begin to see indications of a natural tightening of the House generic ballot for 2010. And it's not so much the African American vote -- though that's a big deal in Georgia -- as it is the youth vote.</p>\n<p>If 18-29 voters are back to 12% of the electorate (where they were in '06) from 17%, that's an automatic 2 points extra for GOP Congressional candidates even if the margin stays at inflated 2008 rates.

And <a href=\"http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2008/11/obamas-organizers-in-georgia-but-not.html\">reading FiveThirtyEight</a>, it's not hard to see why:&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote><p>Whatever turns out to be the case, at the close of early voting Wednesday, according to the Secretary of State's office 345,564 had voted, and 22.5% of those votes were African-American, an ominous dropoff from the 34.5% of black early voters for the general election.</p></blockquote>\n<p>If Saxby does manage to significantly expand from his 3 point lead on November 4th, we can start writing the story of how the African American and youth turnout for Obama really mattered.</p>\n<p>A massive turnout that brings the marginally interested into the process is usually a holy grail for Democrats but one that they haven't been able to tap into until this year. For perspective's sake, just consider that from 2000 to 2004, the electorate expanded by 16% -- and the country voted 3 points more Republican.</p>\n<p>As I wrote in <a href=\"http://www.thenextright.com/patrick-ruffini/the-straight-ticket-youth-vote\">The Straight-Ticket Youth Vote</a>, the identity politics vote based on Obama's personal characteristics -- young and African-American -- may have counted for as much as 6 points of his victory margin -- about 4 points in the increased youth margin and turnout, and about 2 points in increased African American turnout and margin. Not only did this benefit Obama but young people also voted straight ticket for Democratic Congressional candidates. The youth vote on November 4th was about as Democratic as the Latino vote -- and twice as large.</p>\n<p>Those advantages are not going to be at play for Jim Martin, a boring white guy.</p>\n<p>It's in Georgia that we may begin to see indications of a natural tightening of the House generic ballot for 2010. And it's not so much the African American vote -- though that's a big deal in Georgia -- as it is the youth vote.</p>\n<p>If 18-29 voters are back to 12% of the electorate (where they were in '06) from 17%, that's an automatic 2 points extra for GOP Congressional candidates even if the margin stays at inflated 2008 rates. And without Obama at the top of the ticket, it's hard to see how it could. So Obama reshaped the electorate, but probably did it just for one day and one candidate. And if Jim Martin doesn't exceed expectations with Obama's organizers down in Georgia also suggests that the candidate matters more than the tactics in driving GOTV.</p>\n<p>Georgia will be the first test of whether Obama's massive turnout surge proves realigning for other Democrats.

Toyota Motor Corp., Japan&#8217;s largest automaker, sold 106,342 vehicles excluding the Lexus brand, down 28 percent. Sales at Nissan Motor Co., the country&#8217;s third-biggest, fell 30 percent to 30,134.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>[...]</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Honda&#8217;s sales dropped 22 percent to 29,448 vehicles last month. Mazda Motor Corp.&#8217;s fell 33 percent to 9,699 vehicles.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n\t<p>The point here is that auto sales are falling significantly throughout the entire market.  The decline among these stronger, foreign brands are comparable to what the Detroit companies are <a href=\"http://www.freep.com/article/20081130/BUSINESS01/811300390/1210/BUSINESS\">expected</a> to report this week (GM -28%, Ford -33%, Chrysler -42%), and the numbers should help convince Congress that the Big Three&#8217;s troubles are a result of the financial crisis, not poor management.

In a blog announcement on Tuesday, the public was invited to <a href=\"http://change.gov/newsroom/entry/join_the_discussion/\">join the discussion</a>:</p>\n\n\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>Today we&#8217;re trying out a new feature on our website that will allow us get instant feedback from you about our top priorities. We also hope it will allow you to form communities around these issues&#8212;with the best ideas and most interesting discussions floating to the top.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n\t<p>The first discussion that we&#8217;ve all been invited to participate in is about health care reform.  Specifically, the transition team has put out the question, &#8220;What worries you most about the health care system in our country?&#8221;  As of Wednesday night, there are <a href=\"http://change.gov/page/content/discusshealthcare\">2,430 comments</a>, running the gamut from well-researched arguments to  personal stories about experiences in the U.S. health care system.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>The amazing thing about this to me is that the Obama team isn&#8217;t just throwing up a standard comment board that require administrative approval before posting (like some other government sites).  They are using discussion software, made by <a href=\"http://www.intensedebate.com/\">IntenseDebate</a>, that allows commenters to build profiles, earn followers and reputation points, vote up helpful comments and vote down comments that are not helpful, and, by integrating <a href=\"http://openid.net/\">OpenID</a>, to take their followers and reputations to discussions elsewhere on the Web.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>This is a fantastic start to a new kind of governing that is more open and representational than what we have seen before.  As he hinted at on the campaign trail, this is Obama taking the community organizing style of his campaign and moving it into governance.  If the success of his internet tools during the campaign are any indication, his continual use of tools like this could force lawmakers to make policies that better reflect the views of the nation.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>But the Obama team should take it a step further than asking broad questions about hot-button issues.  The new government should allow people to be active players in politics at the legislative level.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>When people really care about an issue, they want to get into the details.  A few quick examples would be <a href=\"http://truthlaidbear.com/immigrationbill0518.php?page=1\">N.Z. Bear</a> posting the comprehensive immigration bill with section-by-section commenting, <a href=\"http://publicmarkup.org/\">PublicMarkup.org</a> posting the financial bailout bill for public review and commenting, and the community around the unemployment bill on <a href=\"http://www.opencongress.org/bill/110-h6867/show\">OpenCongress</a>, where thousand of people worked together to understand the legislation and organize for its passage in Congress.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Again, I&#8217;m thrilled about this step the Obama team has taken.  Now let&#8217;s see a copy of the $600 billion economic recovery plan/stimulus, which is scheduled for a rush job in January, posted online for public discussion before any votes take place!</p>    <img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/OpenCongressCongressGossipBlog/~4/467009129\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" />", "date_published": "2008-11-26 17:37:00", "link": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/OpenCongressCongressGossipBlog/~3/467009129/763-Obama-Gets-Interactve-With-Governance", "date_updated": "2008-11-26 17:37:00"}}, {"pk": 39, "model": "feedinator.feedentry", "fields": {"feed": 4, "author_uri": null, "last_fetched": "2008-12-03 16:54:23", "uid": "tag:opencongress.org,2008-11-25:/article/762", "title": "Neutrality/Decision", "author_email": null, "author_name": "Donny Shaw", "summary": "", "content": "<p><a href=\"http://www.publicknowledge.org/node/1885\">Art Brodsky</a> of <a href=\"http://www.publicknowledge.org/\">Public Knowledge</a> takes a look at how net neutrality votes might line up in the House under a pro-neutrality president-elect:</p>\n\n\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>Starting at the top, President-elect Barack Obama\u2019s platform had as its top technology goal &#8216;Protect the Openness of the Internet.&#8217;  From Waxman on down, Committee members will have the choice of supporting their new, popular president and his enthusiastic supporters, or voting for a local industry.</p>\n\n</blockquote>    <img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/OpenCongressCongressGossipBlog/~4/465511741\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" />", "date_published": "2008-11-25 10:39:00", "link": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/OpenCongressCongressGossipBlog/~3/465511741/762-Neutrality-Decision", "date_updated": "2008-11-25 10:39:00"}}, {"pk": 40, "model": "feedinator.feedentry", "fields": {"feed": 4, "author_uri": null, "last_fetched": "2008-12-03 16:54:23", "uid": "tag:opencongress.org,2008-11-24:/article/761", "title": "Wall St. vs. Main St., Senate Edition", "author_email": null, "author_name": "Donny Shaw", "summary": "", "content": "<p>Just like I did last month with votes in <a href=\"http://www.opencongress.org/articles/view/708-Wall-Street-vs-Main-Street\">the House</a>, here&#8217;s a list of the senators who voted <a href=\"http://www.opencongress.org/roll_call/sublist/5093?party=Republican&vote=Aye\">in favor</a> of the $700 billion financial bailout bill and then voted <a href=\"http://www.opencongress.org/roll_call/sublist/5102?party=Republican&vote=Nay\">against</a> <a href=\"http://www.opencongress.org/bill/110-h6867/show\">H.R.6867</a>, a bill to extend unemployment insurance benefits for people struggling in the nation\u2019s slumping economy:</p>\n\n\n\t<p><a href=\"http://www.opencongress.org/people/show/400576_thomas_coburn\">Sen.
